# Importance of manuscript

In this manuscript I describe a new way to analyze species abundance distributions: the species rank surface (SRS), using multifractal methods. These methods could be applied to a wide range of ecological communities where spatial data is available. I show utility of the method aplying it to spatially explicit community models. 

#

Different communities may have the same species-abundance, the simplest example is a neutral community without local dispersal, I mean one determined only by migration from metacommunity. When I add local dispersal the same SAD is observed and also with different dispersal Kernels the SAD is conserved but SAR and SRS should be different. 

- Metacommunity from periphyton and BCI (log-series)

I use the two sample Kolmogorov-smirnov test

termina diciendo que hacen falta otras medidas de las comunidades
