abstract = {Ecologists sometimes have a less-than-rigorous background in quantitative methods, yet research within this broad field is becoming increasingly mathematical. Written in a step-by-step fashion, Fractals and Multifractals in Ecology and Aquatic Science provides scientists with a basic understanding of fractals and multifractals and the techniques for utilizing them when analyzing ecological phenomenon. With illustrations, tables, and graphs on virtually every page – several in color – this book is a comprehensive source of state-of-the-art ecological scaling and multiscaling methods at temporal and spatial scales, respectfully ranging from seconds to months and from millimeters to thousands of kilometers. It illustrates most of the data analysis techniques with real case studies often based on original findings. It also incorporates descriptions of current and new numerical techniques to analyze and deepen understanding of ecological situations and their solutions. Includes a Wealth of Applications and Examples This book also includes nonlinear analysis techniques and the application of concepts from chaos theory to problems of spatial and temporal patterns in ecological systems. Unlike other books on the subject, Fractals and Multifractals in Ecology and Aquatic Science is readily accessible to researchers in a variety of fields, such as microbiology, biology, ecology, hydrology, geology, oceanography, social sciences, and finance, regardless of their mathematical backgrounds. This volume demystifies the mathematical methods, many of which are often regarded as too complex, and allows the reader to access new and promising concepts, procedures, and related results.},

@article{Zillio2007,
abstract = {We present a spatially-explicit generalization of Hubbell's model of community dynamics in which the assumption of neutrality is relaxed by incorporating dispersal limitation and habitat preference. In simulations, diversity and species abundances were governed by the rate at which new species were introduced (usually called 'speciation') and nearly unaffected by dispersal limitation and habitat preference. Of course, in the absence of species input, diversity is maintained solely by niche differences. We conclude that the success of the neutral model in predicting the abundance distribution has nothing to do with neutrality, but rather with the species-introduction process: when new species enter a community regularly as singletons, the typical J-shaped abundance distribution, with a long tail of rare species, is always observed, whether species differ in habitat preferences or not. We suggest that many communities are indeed driven by the introduction process, accounting for high diversity and rarity, and that species differences may be largely irrelevant for either.},

abstract = {The relationship between the number of species and the area sampled is one of the oldest and best-documented patterns in community ecology. Several theoretical models and Þeld data from a wide range of plant and animal taxa suggest that the slope, z, of a graph of the logarithm of species richness against the logarithm of area is roughly constant, with z '0.25. We collected replicated and randomized plant data at 11 spatial scales from 0.01 to 10 8 square meters in Great Britain which show that the slope of the log-log plot is not constant, but varies systematically with spatial scale, and from habitat to habitat at the same spatial scale. Values of z were low (0.1 to 0.2) at small scales (,100 square meters), high (0.4 to 0.5) at intermediate scales (1 hectare to 10 square kilometers), and low again (0.1 to 0.2) for the largest scale transitions (e.g., East Berks to all of Berkshire). Instead of one process determining changes in species richness across a wide range of scales, different processes might determine plant biodiversity at different spatial scales.},

abstract = {Part 1. It is shown that in a large collection of Lepidoptera captured in Malaya the frequency of the number of species represented by different numbers of individuals fitted somewhat closely to a hyperbola type of curve, so long as only the rarer species were considered. The data for the commoner species was not so strictly `randomized', but the whole series could be closely fitted by a series of the logarithmic type as described by Fisher in Part 3. Other data for random collections of insects in the field were also shown to fit fairly well to this series. Part 2. Extensive data on the capture of about 1500 Macrolepidoptera of about 240 species in a light-trap at Harpenden is analysed in relation to Fisher's mathematical theory and is shown to fit extremely closely to the calculations. The calculations are applied first to the frequency of occurrence of species represented by different numbers of individuals--and secondly to the number of species in samples of different sizes from the same population. The parameter ` alpha ', which it is suggested should be called the `index of diversity', is shown to have a regular seasonal change in the case of the Macrolepidoptera in the trap. In addition, samples from two traps which overlooked somewhat different vegetation are shown to have ` alpha ' values which are significantly different. It is shown that, provided the samples are not small, ` alpha ' is the increase in the number of species obtained by increasing the size of a sample by e (2.718). A diagram is given (Fig. 8) from which any one of the values, total number of species, total number of individuals and index of diversity (alpha), can be obtained approximately if the other two are known. The standard error of alpha is also indicated on the same diagram. Part 3. A theoretical distribution is developed which appears to be suitable for the frequencies with which different species occur in a random collection, in the common case in which many species are so rare that their chance of inclusion is small. The relationships of the new distribution with the negative binomial and the Poisson series are established. Numerical processes are exhibited for fitting the series to observations containing given numbers of species and individuals, and for estimating the parameter alpha representing the richness in species of the material sampled; secondly, for calculating the standard error of alpha, and thirdly, for testing whether the series exhibits a significant deviation from the limiting form used. Special tables are presented for facilitating these calculations.},

abstract = {The consistency of the species abundance distribution across diverse communities has attracted widespread attention. In this paper, I argue that the consistency of pattern arises because diverse ecological mechanisms share a common symmetry with regard to measurement scale. By symmetry, I mean that different ecological processes preserve the same measure of information and lose all other information in the aggregation of various perturbations. I frame these explanations of symmetry, measurement, and aggregation in terms of a recently developed extension to the theory of maximum entropy. I show that the natural measurement scale for the species abundance distribution is log-linear: the information in observations at small population sizes scales logarithmically and, as population size increases, the scaling of information grades from logarithmic to linear. Such log-linear scaling leads naturally to a gamma distribution for species abundance, which matches well with the observed patterns. Much of the variation between samples can be explained by the magnitude at which the measurement scale grades from logarithmic to linear. This measurement approach can be applied to the similar problem of allelic diversity in population genetics and to a wide variety of other patterns in biology.},

abstract = {Understanding species richness patterns represents one of the most fundamental problems in ecology. Most research in this area has focused on spatial gradients of species richness, with a smaller area of emphasis dedicated to understanding the temporal dynamics of richness. However, few attempts have been made to understand the linkages between the spatial and temporal patterns related to richness. Here, we argue that spatial and temporal richness patterns and the processes that drive them are inherently linked, and that our understanding of richness will be substantially improved by considering them simultaneously. The species-time-area relationship provides a case in point: successful description of the empirical spatio-temporal pattern led to a rapid development and testing of new theories. Other areas of research on species richness could also benefit from an explicitly spatio-temporal approach, and we suggest future directions for understanding the processes common to these two traditionally isolated fields of research.},

abstract = {The spatial structure of neutral communities has nontrivial properties, which are described traditionally by the Species-Area relationship (SAR) and the Species Abundance Distribution, (SAD). Fractal analysis is an alternative way to describe community structure, the final product of which – a multifractal spectrum – combines information both on the scaling parameters of species richness (similar to SAR), and about species' relative abundances (similar to \{SAD).\} We conducted a multifractal analysis of community spatial structure in a neutral lattice-based model. In a realistic range of dispersal distances, moments of the species abundance distribution form a family of curves of the same shape, which are reduced to a single universal curve through a scaling collapse procedure. Trivial scaling is observed on small and large scales, which reflects homogeneity of species distribution at small scales and a limiting log-series distribution at large scales. Multifractal spectra for different speciation rates and dispersal kernels are obtained for the intermediate region of scaling. Analysis of spectra reveals that the key model parameters determine not only the species richness and its scaling, but also of species dominance and rarity. We discovered a phenomenon of negative dimensions in the multifractal spectrum. Negative dimensions have no direct interpretation from a purely physical point of view, but have biological meaning because they reflect the negative relationship between the number of singletons and the area.},

We focus upon the scaling properties of such measures, by considering their singularities, which are characterized by two indices: alpha , which determines the strength of their singularities; and f, which describes how densely they are distributed. The spectrum of singularities is described by giving the possible range of alpha values and the function f( alpha ). We apply this formalism to the 2 [infinity] cycle of period doubling, to the devil's staircase of mode locking, and to trajectories on 2-tori with golden-mean winding numbers. In all cases the new formalism allows an introduction of smooth functions to characterize the measures. We believe that this formalism is readily applicable to experiments and should result in new tests of global universality.},

abstract = {Abstract: The joint spatial and temporal fluctuations in the community structure of tropical butterflies are analyzed by fitting the bivariate Poisson lognormal distribution to a large number of observations in space and time. By applying multivariate dependent diffusions for describing the fluctuations in the abundances, the environmental variance is estimated to be very large and so is the strength of local density regulation. The variance in the lognormal species abundance distribution is partitioned into components expressing the heterogeneity between the species, independent noise components for the different species, a demographic stochastic component, and a component due to overdispersion in the sampling. In disagreement with the neutral theory, the estimates show that the heterogeneity component is the dominating one, representing 81\% of the total variance in the lognormal model. Different spatial components of diversity, the alpha, beta, and gamma diversity, are also estimated. The spatial scale of the autocorrelation function for the community is of order 1 km, while sampling of a quadrat would need to be 10 km on a side to yield the total diversity for the community.},

abstract = {Neutral models in landscape ecology that have been used as a framework to analyze actual landscapes have been largely planar. However, the natural world is greater than two dimensions; hence, many ecological structures, e.g., forest canopies or coral reefs, are better represented by topographies or tomographies. Because pattern and process or structure and function are intertwined, it becomes necessary. to develop methods to quantify these complex architectures. With the advent of remote sensing technologies such as lidars and sonars, that permit structural mapping of some of these systems, volumetric data are becoming more prevalent. In this study, we developed a suite of binary voxel-based neutral models that possessed random, anisotropic, and hierarchical properties. We then evaluated the extent to which fractal-derived measurements, i.e., lacunarity, the simple fractal dimension, and multifractal spectra, were able to discern among the constructed model types at two different densities (p = 0.02 and p = 0.05). Multifractal analysis, where spectra were defined by three parameters, was shown to be the most sensitive to the differences among the neutral structures. Lactunarity, defined by a single parameter, was shown to be fairly useful in discerning the structures. The simple fractal dimension was found to have limited capability. To more fully assess the ability of these and additional pattern recognition methods, better representations of natural morphologies need to be developed and analyzed.},

Here, we review theoretical, empirical and statistical developments in the study of SADs. Several key points emerge. (i) Literally dozens of models have been proposed to explain the hollow curve. Unfortunately, very few models are ever rejected, primarily because few theories make any predictions beyond the hollow-curve SAD itself. (ii) Interesting work has been performed both empirically and theoretically, which goes beyond the hollow-curve prediction to provide a rich variety of information about how SADs behave. These include the study of SADs along environmental gradients and theories that integrate SADs with other biodiversity patterns. Central to this body of work is an effort to move beyond treating the SAD in isolation and to integrate the SAD into its ecological context to enable making many predictions. (iii) Moving forward will entail understanding how sampling and scale affect SADs and developing statistical tools for describing and comparing SADs. We are optimistic that SADs can provide significant insights into basic and applied ecological science.},

abstract = {The Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology (METE) predicts a universal species–area relationship (SAR) that can be fully characterized using only the total abundance (N) and species richness (S) at a single spatial scale. This theory has shown promise for characterizing scale dependence in the SAR. However, there are currently four different approaches to applying METE to predict the SAR and it is unclear which approach should be used due to a lack of empirical comparison. Specifically, METE can be applied recursively or non-recursively and can use either a theoretical or observed species-abundance distribution (SAD). We compared the four different combinations of approaches using empirical data from 16 datasets containing over 1000 species and 300,000 individual trees and herbs. In general, METE accurately downscaled the SAR (R2 > 0.94), but the recursive approach consistently under-predicted richness. METE’s accuracy did not depend strongly on using the observed or predicted SAD. This suggests that the best approach to scaling diversity using METE is to use a combination of non-recursive scaling and the theoretical abundance distribution, which allows predictions to be made across a broad range of spatial scales with only knowledge of the species richness and total abundance at a single scale.},

abstract = {For millimeter-scale aquatic crustaceans such as copepods, ensuring reproductive success is a challenge as potential mates are often separated by hundreds of body lengths in a 3D environment. At the evolutionary scale, this led to the development of remote sensing abilities and behavioral strategies to locate, to track, and to capture a mate. Chemoreception plays a crucial role in increasing mate encounter rates through pheromone clouds and pheromone trails that can be followed over many body lengths. Empirical evidence of trail following behavior is, however, limited to laboratory experiments conducted in still water. An important open question concerns what happens in the turbulent waters of the surface ocean. We propose that copepods experience, and hence react to, a bulk-phase water pheromone concentration. Here we investigate the mating behavior of two key copepod species, Temora longicornis and Eurytemora affinis, to assess the role of background pheromone concentration and the relative roles played by males and females in mating encounters. We find that both males and females react to background pheromone concentration and exhibit both innate and acquired components in their mating strategies. The emerging swimming behaviors have stochastic properties that depend on pheromone concentration, sex, and species, are related to the level of reproductive experience of the individual tested, and significantly diverge from both the L\'{e}vy and Brownian models identified in predators searching for low- and high-density prey. Our results are consistent with an adaptation to increase mate encounter rates and hence to optimize reproductive fitness and success.},

However, very few studies have linked fractal properties of landscapes to generating ecological mechanisms and dynamics. In this study I show that lacunarity (a measure of the landscape texture) is a well suited ecologically scaled landscape index that can be explicitly incorporated in metapopulation models such as the classical Levins equation. I show that the average lacunarity of an aggregated landscape is linearly correlated to the habitat that a species with local spatial processed information may perceive. Lacunarity is a computationally feasible index to measure, and is related to the metapopulation capacity of landscapes. A general approach to multifractal landscapes has been conceived, and some analytical results for self-similar landscapes are outlined, including the specific effect of landscape heterogeneity, decoupled from that of contagion by dispersal. Spatially explicit simulations show agreement with the semi-implicit method presented.},

The first section provides introductory material and different definitions of a multifractal measure. The author then examines some of the various constructions for describing multifractal measures. Building from the theory of large deviations, he focuses on constructions based on lattice coverings, covering by point-centered spheres, and cascades processes. The final section presents estimators of Renyi dimensions of integer order two and greater and discusses their properties. It also explores various applications of dimension estimation and provides a detailed case study of spatial point patterns of earthquake locations. Estimating fractal dimensions holds particular value in studies of nonlinear dynamical systems, time series, and spatial point patterns. With its careful yet practical blend of multifractals, estimation methods, and case studies, Multifractals: Theory and Applications provides a unique opportunity to explore the estimation methods from a statistical perspective.},

abstract = {The scale-dependent species abundance distribution (\{SAD)\} is fundamental in ecology, but few spatially explicit models of this pattern have thus far been studied. Here we show spatially explicit neutral model predictions for \{SADs\} over a wide range of spatial scales, which appear to match empirical patterns qualitatively. We find that the assumption of a log-series \{SAD\} in the metacommunity made by spatially implicit neutral models can be justified with a spatially explicit model in the large area limit. Furthermore, our model predicts that \{SADs\} on multiple scales are characterized by a single, compound parameter that represents the ratio of the survey area to the species’ average biogeographic range (which is in turn set by the speciation rate and the dispersal distance). This intriguing prediction is in line with recent empirical evidence for a universal scaling of the species-area curve. Hence we hypothesize that empirical \{SAD\} patterns will show a similar universal scaling for many different taxa and across multiple spatial scales.},

Difficulties in discriminating among mathematical models and the ecological mechanisms underlying them are likely related to a phenomenon first described by Frank Preston. He noted that the frequency distribution of abundances among species was uncannily similar to the Boltzmann distribution of kinetic energies among gas molecules and the Pareto distribution of incomes among wage earners. We provide additional examples to show that four different 'distributions of wealth' (species abundance distributions, species-area and species-time relations, and distance decay of compositional similarity) are not unique to ecology, but have analogues in other physical, geological, economic and cultural systems. Because these appear to be general statistical patterns characteristic of many complex dynamical systems they are likely not generated by uniquely ecological mechanistic processes.},

abstract = {Mechanisms proposed to explain the maintenance of species diversity within ecological communities of sessile organisms include niche differentiation mediated by competitive trade-offs, frequency dependence resulting from species-specific pests, recruitment limitation due to local dispersal, and a speciation-extinction dynamic equilibrium mediated by stochasticity (drift). While each of these processes, and more, have been shown to act in particular communities, much remains to be learned about their relative importance in shaping community-level patterns. We used a spatially-explicit, individual-based model to assess the effects of each of these processes on species richness, relative abundance, and spatial patterns such as the species-area curve. Our model communities had an order-of-magnitude more individuals than any previous such study, and we also developed a finite-size scaling analysis to infer the large-scale properties of these systems in order to establish the generality of our conclusions across system sizes. As expected, each mechanism can promote diversity. We found some qualitative differences in community patterns across communities in which different combinations of these mechanisms operate. Species-area curves follow a power law with short-range dispersal and a logarithmic law with global dispersal. Relative-abundance distributions are more even for systems with competitive differences and trade-offs than for those in which all species are competitively equivalent, and they are most even when frequency dependence (even if weak) is present. Overall, however, communities in which different processes operated showed surprisingly similar patterns, which suggests that the form of community-level patterns cannot in general be used to distinguish among mechanisms maintaining diversity there. Nevertheless, parameterization of models such as these from field data on the strengths of the different mechanisms could yield insight into their relative roles in diversity maintenance in any given community.},

abstract = {Species abundance distributions \{(SADs)\} have played a historical role in the development of community ecology. They summarize information about the number and the relative abundance of the species encountered in a sample from a given community. For years ecologists have developed theory to characterize species abundance patterns, and the study of these patterns has received special attention in recent years. In particular, ecologists have developed statistical sampling theories to predict the \{SAD\} expected in a sample taken from a region. Here, we emphasize an important limitation of all current sampling theories: they ignore species identity. We present an alternative formulation of statistical sampling theory that incorporates species asymmetries in sampling and dynamics, and relate, in a general way, the community-level \{SAD\} to the distribution of population abundances of the species integrating the community. We illustrate the theory on a stochastic community model that can accommodate species asymmetry. Finally, we discuss the potentially important role of species asymmetries in shaping recently observed multi-humped \{SADs\} and in comparisons of the relative success of niche and neutral theories at predicting \{SADs.\}},

abstract = {The species-abundance distribution (SAD) is one of the most studied patterns in ecology due to its potential insights into commonness and rarity, community assembly, and patterns of biodiversity. It is well established that communities are comprised of a few common and many rare species, and numerous theoretical models have been proposed to explain this pattern. However, no attempt has been made to determine how well these theoretical characterizations capture observed taxonomic- and global-scale spatial variation in the general form of the distribution. Here, using data of a scope unprecedented in community ecology, we show that a simple maximum entropy model produces a truncated log-series distribution that can predict between 83\% and 93\% of the observed variation in the rank abundance of species across 15,848 globally distributed communities including birds, mammals, plants, and butterflies. This model requires knowledge of only the species richness and total abundance of the community to predict the full abundance distribution, which suggests that these factors are sufficient to understand the distribution for most purposes. Since geographic patterns in richness and abundance can often be successfully modeled, this approach should allow the distribution of commonness and rarity to be characterized, even in locations where empirical data are unavailable.},

Recently, Harte et al. argued that the slope of the SAR for a given area is driven by a single parameter, the ratio between total number of individuals and number of species (i.e., the mean population size across species at a given scale). We provide a geometric interpretation of this dependence. At the same time, however, we show that this dependence cannot be universal across taxa: if it holds for a taxon composed from two subsets of species and also for one of its subsets, it cannot simultaneously hold for the other subset. Using three data sets, we show that the slope of the SAR considerably varies around the prediction. We estimate the limits of this variation by using geometric considerations, providing a theory based on species spatial turnover at different scales. We argue that the SAR cannot be strictly universal, but its slope at each particular scale varies within the constraints given by species’ spatial turnover at finer spatial scales, and this variation is biologically informative.},

We find that the species abundance distribution (\{SAD)\} is insensitive to the details of the size structure in our model, demonstrating that the \{SAD\} is a poor indicator of size-dependent processes. We also derive the species biomass distribution (\{SBD)\} and find that the form of the \{SBD\} depends on the underlying size structure. This leads to a prescription for testing multiple, intertwined ecological predictions of the model, and provides evidence that alternatives to the traditional \{SAD\} are more closely tied to certain ecological processes.

abstract = {The unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography is increasingly accepted as an informative null model of community composition and dynamics. It has successfully produced macro-ecological patterns such as species-area relationships and species abundance distributions. However, the models employed make many unrealistic auxiliary assumptions. For example, the popular spatially implicit version assumes a local plot exchanging migrants with a large panmictic regional source pool. This simple structure allows rigorous testing of its fit to data. In contrast, spatially explicit models assume that offspring disperse only limited distances from their parents, but one cannot as yet test the significance of their fit to data. Here we compare the spatially explicit and the spatially implicit model, fitting the most-used implicit model (with two levels, local and regional) to data simulated by the most-used spatially explicit model (where offspring are distributed about their parent on a grid according to either a radially symmetric Gaussian or a 'fat-tailed' distribution). Based on these fits, we express spatially implicit parameters in terms of spatially explicit parameters. This suggests how we may obtain estimates of spatially explicit parameters from spatially implicit ones. The relationship between these parameters, however, makes no intuitive sense. Furthermore, the spatially implicit model usually fits observed species-abundance distributions better than those calculated from the spatially explicit model's simulated data. Current spatially explicit neutral models therefore have limited descriptive power. However, our results suggest that a fatter tail of the dispersal kernel seems to improve the fit, suggesting that dispersal kernels with even fatter tails should be studied in future. We conclude that more advanced spatially explicit models and tools to analyze them need to be developed.},

Species-area relationships (SARs), measuring how the number of observed species increases upon enlarging the sampled area, constitute a convenient tool for quantifying the spatial structure of biodiversity. While general features of species-area curves are quite universal across ecosystems, some quantitative aspects can change significantly. Several attempts have been made to link these variations to ecological forces. Within the framework of spatially explicit neutral models, here we scrutinize the effect of varying the local population size (i.e. the number of individuals per site) and the level of habitat saturation (allowing for empty sites). We conclude that species-area curves become shallower when the local population size increases, while habitat saturation, unless strongly violated, plays a marginal role. Our findings provide a plausible explanation of why SARs for microorganisms are flatter than those for larger organisms.},

abstract = {The composition of communities of sessile organisms, and the change in species diversity with time, is a spatially explicit phenomenon. Three spatial factors clearly affect diversity: (1) the structure and heterogeneity of the landscape that limits species immigration and ultimate community size; (2) neighborhood interactions that determine colonization and extinction rates and influence residence times of local populations; and (3) disturbances that open spatially contiguous areas for recolonization by less abundant species. The importance of these three factors was first reviewed and then examined with a spatially explicit, multi-species model of plant dispersal, competition and establishment, with an assumption of neutrality (all species had equivalent life histories) that reduced the initial dimensionality of the problem. The simulations assumed that the probability of immigration was a linear function of mainland abundance and distance to islands, similar to the equilibrium theory of island biogeography and the unified neutral theory of biodiversity. The rate of increase in species richness was not constant across island sizes, declining as island area became very large. This pattern was explained by the spatial dynamics of colonization and establishment, a non-random process that cannot be explained by passive sampling alone. Simulations showed that population establishment depended critically on rare long-distance dispersal events while population persistence was achieved by the formation of aggregated species distributions that developed through restricted dispersal and local competitive interactions. Nevertheless, species richness always declined to a single species in the absence of disturbances, while up to 40 species could persist to 10,000 years when spatially dependent mortality was added. Further explorations with spatially explicit models will be required to fully appreciate the consequence of land use change and altered disturbance regimes on patterns of species distribution and the maintenance of diversity.},

We show that the shape of diversity-disturbance curves differs considerably depending on the type of coexistence mechanism assumed: (1) Neutral communities generally show decreasing diversity-disturbance curves with maximum diversity at zero disturbance rates contradicting the IDH, whereas trade-off communities generally show unimodal relationships confirming the IDH and (2) density-dependent mechanisms do increase the diversity of both neutral and trade-off communities.

abstract = {We show that fractals in general and strange attractors in particular are characterized by an infinite number of generalized dimensions Dq, q > 0. To this aim we develop a rescaling transformation group which yields analytic expressions for all the quantities Dq. We prove that lim q→0Dq = fractal dimension (D), limq→1Dq = information dimension ($\sigma$) and Dq=2 = correlation exponent (v). Dq with other integer q's correspond to exponents associated with ternary, quaternary and higher correlation functions. We prove that generally Dq > Dq for any q′ > q. For homogeneous fractals Dq = Dq. A particularly interesting dimension is Dq=∞. For two examples (Feigenbaum attractor, generalized baker's transformation) we calculate the generalized dimensions and find that D∞ is a non-trivial number. All the other generalized dimensions are bounded between the fractal dimension and D∞.},

@article{ricotta_parametric_2002,
abstract = {We propose a measure of divergence from species to life-form diversity aimed at summarizing the ecological similarity among different plant communities without losing information on traditional taxonomic diversity. First, species and life-form relative abundances within a given plant community are determined. Next, using R\'{e}nyi's generalized entropy, the diversity profiles of the analyzed community are computed both from species and life-form relative abundances. Finally, the speed of decrease from species to life-form diversity is obtained by combining the outcome of both profiles. Interestingly, the proposed measure shows some formal analogies with multifractal functions developed in statistical physics for the analysis of spatial patterns. As an application for demonstration, a small data set from a plant community sampled in the archaeological site of Paestum (southern Italy) is used.},

@article{Borda-de-Agua2002,
abstract = {Although fractals have been applied in ecology for some time, multifractals have, in contrast, received little attention. In this article, we apply multifractals to the species-area relationship and species abundance distributions. We highlight two results: first, species abundance distributions collected at different spatial scales may collapse into a single curve after appropriate renormalization, and second, the power-law form of the species-area relationship and the Shannon, Simpson, and Berger-Parker diversity indices belong to a family of equations relating the species number, species abundance, and area through the moments of the species abundance–probability density function. Explicit formulas for these diversity indices, as a function of area, are derived. Methods to obtain the multifractal spectra from a data set are discussed, and an example is shown with data on tree and shrub species collected in a 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Finally, we discuss the implications of the multifractal formalism to the relationship between species range and abundance and the relation between the shape of the species abundance distribution and area.},

@article{Pigolotti2013,
abstract = {We study a stochastic community model able to interpolate from a neutral regime to a niche partitioned regime upon varying a single parameter tuning the intensity of niche stabilization, namely the difference between intraspecific and interspecific competition. By means of a self-consistent approach, we obtain an analytical expression for the species abundance distribution, in excellent agreement with stochastic simulations of the model. In the neutral limit, the Fisher log-series is recovered, while upon increasing the stabilization strength the species abundance distribution develops a maximum for species at intermediate abundances, corresponding to the emergence of a carrying capacity. Numerical studies of species extinction-time distribution show that niche-stabilization strongly affects also the dynamical properties of the system by increasing the average species lifetimes, while suppressing their fluctuations. The results are discussed in view of the niche-neutral debate and of their potential relevance to field data.},

@article{sizling_power-law_2004,
abstract = {The species–area relationship (\{SAR)\} is often expressed as a power law, which indicates scale invariance. It has been claimed that the scale invariance – or self-similarity at the community level – is not compatible with the self-similarity at the level of spatial distribution of individual species, because the power law would only emerge if distributions for all species had identical fractal dimensions (\{FD).\} Here we show that even if species differ in their \{FD\}, the resulting \{SAR\} is approximately linear on a log–log scale because observed spatial distributions are inevitably spatially restricted – a phenomenon we term the ‘finite-area effect’. Using distribution atlases, we demonstrate that the apparent power law of \{SARs\} for central European birds is attributable to this finite-area effect affecting species that indeed reveal self-similar distributions. We discuss implications of this mechanism producing the \{SAR.\}},

@article{Chisholm2010,
abstract = {A fundamental challenge in ecology is to understand the mechanisms that govern patterns of relative species abundance. Previous numerical simulations have suggested that complex niche-structured models produce species abundance distributions (SADs) that are qualitatively similar to those of very simple neutral models that ignore differences between species. However, in the absence of an analytical treatment of niche models, one cannot tell whether the two classes of model produce the same patterns via similar or different mechanisms. We present an analytical proof that, in the limit as diversity becomes large, a strong niche model give rises to exactly the same asymptotic form of SAD as the neutral model, and we verify the analytical predictions for a Panamanian tropical forest data set. Our results strongly suggest that neutral processes drive patterns of relative species abundance in high-diversity ecological communities, even when strong niche structure exists. However, neutral theory cannot explain what generates high diversity in the first place, and it may not be valid in low-diversity communities. Our results also confirm that neutral theory cannot be used to infer an absence of niche structure or to explain ecosystem function.},

@article{yakimov_nonconcavity_2014,
abstract = {Species–area relationship and species abundance distribution are two of the most studied patterns in community ecology. Multifractal analysis, combining elements of analysis of both patterns in a unified framework, is a very promising method for studying the community spatial structure. However, most empirical applications of multifractal analysis revealed an abnormal result: an increasing spectrum of Renyi generalised dimensions. We argue that an abnormal form of another function, namely, mass exponents’ spectrum, is a more important problem. We hypothesise that the reason for the abnormal results is the spatial heterogeneity of the species abundance distribution. This leads to disproportionate contribution of subplots with high dominance or extreme rarity during averaging over the whole area. The effect arises from the use of arithmetic mean. We propose two new algorithms for calculation of mass exponents to solve the specified problem based, first, on the use of geometric mean and, second, on the calculation of local exponents and their subsequent averaging. We test the proposed approaches on the material of multifractal analysis of the spatial structure of the two communities: tropical moist forest and mixed deciduous forest. Results show that both communities are characterised by scale-specific heterogeneity of relative abundance extrema. New algorithms produce correct Renyi spectra, but mass exponents’ spectra do not get strict concavity in all cases, although the range of concavity expands. As a rule of thumb, we propose to use truncated multifractal spectra constructed from the mass exponents in the range of strict concavity. The use of truncated spectra allows obtaining biologically interpretable information about community structure, which enables ecological analysis to advance much further than with the use of Renyi spectra.},

@article{Yakimov2008,
abstract = {The species-area relationship, SAR, is the first approximation to describe the spatial structure at the community level. This relation, however, takes only species richness into account and ignores interspecific differences in spatial patterns, such as dominance or rarity. The description of such patterns may be achieved via multifractal analysis, allowing the transition from SAR to the diversity-area relation, DAR. This study analyzes the spatial structure of a dune slack plant community, which can be considered as a multifractal object, at a scale level between 25 cm and 2 m. We applied a complete multifractal analysis including both R\'{e}nyi spectrum and multifractal spectrum, using confidence intervals. The results indicated that we succeeded for the first time deriving generalized R\'{e}nyi dimensions’ spectrum without anomalies for diversity patterns in a plant community. We propose an interpretation of the multifractal spectrum in ecological terms as diversity patterns of subsets of species with a similar spatial distribution.},
