\caption{Spatial patterns generated with logseries and uniform species abundance distribution (all species have the same density) with 64 species and a grid with side=256. a) Regular: species are distributed in vertical bands. b) Randomized: the positon of species are distributed at random in space.}

\caption{Generalized dimension spectra $D_q$ of simulated species spatial patterns. The points are means of 10 repetitions of simulated patterns using a spatial grid of side=256. A logseries or uniform species abundance distribution were used, with 8,64 and 256 species. Two forms of generalized dimensions were estimated: DqSRS, from species rank surface $D_q^{SRS}$. DqSAD, estimated from species abundance distribution $D_q^{SAD}$. Two different spatial patterns were used: Regular, the species are distributed in vertical bands, Randomized the spatial distribution of species was randomized.}

\caption{Linear fit from generalized dimension ($D_q$) estimation showing a range of $q$ from -4 to 4. The spatial grid has a side=256 occupied with 64 species with a uniform abundance distribution. Two different spatial patterns were used: a) Regular, a regular spatial pattern with species distributed in vertical bands of equal width. b) Randomized, the positions of species in the grid are randomized. Two kinds of generalized dimension were estimated: DqSRS corresponds the fit of $D_q^{SRS}$ (see text) and DqSAD is the fit from the estimation of $D_q^{SAD}$ (see text). $Z_q(\epsilon)$ corresponds to the partition function calculated for a box with side $\epsilon$ in the SRS case, in SAD case, $\epsilon$ represent the area of the box used.}

\caption{Coeficient of determination $R^2$ from the regresions to estimate generalized dimension $D_q$ of simulated species spatial patterns. The moment order $q$ is in the range [-24,24], the simulated pattern use a spatial grid of side=256 and 64 species with a uniform and logseries abundance distribution. Two different spatial patterns were used, Regular: a regular spatial pattern, with species distributed in vertical bands. Randomized, the positions of species in the grid are randomized. Two kinds of generalized dimension were estimated: DqSAD, the $R^2$ are from the estimation of $D_q^{SAD}$ (see text). DqSRS, the $R^2$ are from the regresions to estimate $D_q^{SRS}$ (see text).}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6.5in]{spat_NeuLog64_256.png}
\caption{Spatial patterns generated with a spatial neutral/hierarchical model. \textit{Replacement} is the parameter that determines the degree of neutrality. When this parameter is 0 the model is completely neutral and there is no competitive replacement of species. When \textit{Replacement} is 1 competitive superior species always replaces inferior ones and the model is completely hierarchical. The simulations use a metacommunity with a logseries abundance distribution with 86 species and a simulation grid side=256.}

\includegraphics[width=6.5in]{RAD_NeuLog_spMeta_256.png}
\caption{Rank abundace diagrams of comunities patterns generated with a spatial neutral/hierarchical model with different number of species in the metacommunity (labelled in each subfigure). \textit{Replacement} is the parameter that determines the degree of neutrality. When this parameter is 0 the model is completely neutral and there is no competitive replacement of species. When \textit{Replacement} is 1 competitive superior species always replaces inferior ones and the model is completely hierarchical. The simulations use a metacommunity with a logseries abundance distribution with 11, 86 and 341 species and a simulation grid side=256, the other parameters used were MortalityRate=0.2, DispersalDistance=0.4 (2.5 grid units), ColonizationRate=0.001.}
