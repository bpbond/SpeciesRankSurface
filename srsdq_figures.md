Table: Power and Type I error rate of Anderson-Darling statistic to test hypothesis of differences in:  species abundance distributions (SAD), generalized dimension based on SAD ($D_q^{SAD}$) and generalized dimension based on SRS ($D_q^{SRS}$). The power is calculated testing communities with different $\rho$ and type I error is calculated for communities with the same $\rho$. The p-values were estimated using 1000 randomizations. The number of points used for SAD comparisons is the number of species found in the communities. The number of points used for multifractal spectra correspond to the q in the range -10 to 10 (n=21), according to the following set q={-10,-8,-6,-4,-3,-2.5,-2,-1.5,-1,-0.5,0,0.5,1,1.5,2,2.5,3,4,6,8,10}. The number of comparisons for the power calculations were n=25000 except for SAD with side 500 & metacommunity 11, where some comparison with less than 3 species were skipped (n=23800). For type I error the comparisons were n=6125, and the same exception applies (n=5846).

\caption{Generalized dimension spectra $D_q$ of simulated species spatial patterns. The points are means of 10 simulated patterns using a spatial grid of side=256. A logseries or uniform species abundance distribution were used, with 8,64 and 256 species. Two forms of generalized dimensions were estimated: DqSRS, from species rank surface $D_q^{SRS}$. DqSAD, estimated from species abundance distribution $D_q^{SAD}$. I use two spatial patterns: Regular, the species are distributed in vertical bands, Randomized the spatial distribution of species was randomized.}

\caption{Linear fit from generalized dimension ($D_q$) estimation showing a range of $q$ from -4 to 4. The spatial grid has a side=256 occupied with 64 species with a uniform abundance distribution. Two different spatial patterns were used: a) Regular, a regular spatial pattern with species distributed in vertical bands of equal width. b) Randomized, the positions of species in the grid are randomized. Two kinds of generalized dimension were estimated: DqSRS corresponds the fit of $D_q^{SRS}$ (see text) and DqSAD is the fit from the estimation of $D_q^{SAD}$ (see text). $Z_q(\epsilon)$ corresponds to the partition function calculated for a box with side $\epsilon$ in the SRS case, in SAD case, $\epsilon$ represent the area of the box used.}
