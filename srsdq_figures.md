\caption{Spatial patterns generated with a uniform species abundance distribution (all species have the same density) with 64 species and a grid with side=256. a) Regular: species are distributed in bands of equal width. b) Random: species are distributed at random in space.}

\caption{Generalized dimension spectra $D_q$ with $q$ in the range [-24,24], using a spatial grid of side=256 and 64 species with a uniform abundance distribution. Two different spatial patterns were used: Circles correspond to a regular spatial pattern, with species are distributed in vertical bands of equal width. Triangles correspond to a random distribution of species.  a) $D_q$ estimated from species rank surface (SRS, see text) b) $D_q$ estimated from species abundance distribution (SAD, see text).}

\caption{Coeficient of determination $R^2$ from the regresions to estimate generalized dimension $D_q$ with $q$ in the range [-24,24], using a spatial grid of side=256 and 64 species with a uniform abundance distribution. Two different spatial patterns were used, Regular: a regular spatial pattern, with species distributed in vertical bands of equal width. The random  pattern corresponds to a random distribution of species in the grid. Two kinds of generalized dimension were estimated. a) $R^2$ from the regresions to estimate $D_q^{SRS}$ (see text) b) $R^2$ from the estimation of  $D_q^{SAD}$ (see text).}

\caption{Linear fit from generalized dimension ($D_q$) estimation showing a range of $q$ from -4 to 4. The spatial grid has a side=256 occupied with 64 species with a uniform abundance distribution. Two different spatial patterns were used, Regular: a regular spatial pattern, with species distributed in vertical bands of equal width. Random:  species are distributed at random in the grid. Two kinds of generalized dimension were estimated: SRS corresponds the fit of $D_q^{SRS}$ (see text) and SAD is the fit from the estimation of  $D_q^{SAD}$ (see text). $Z_q(\epsilon)$ corresponds to the partition function calculated for a box with side $\epsilon$ in the SRS case, in SAD case, $\epsilon$ represent the area of the box used.}
