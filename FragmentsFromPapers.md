The results here suggest that the scale of dispersal is the
most important factor in determining the shapes of SACs
and the only one about which conclusions can be drawn
from the shapes of observed curves. More specifically, the
important question is the speed of dispersal relative to the
speciation rate; these together define the correlation length
of the system (Durrett and Levin 1996).

This suggests that most real communities do not exhibit the sort of
density dependence modeled here, one that is identical in
strength across all species. Future work should examine

However, most of the patterns commonly investigated by ecologists are surprisingly robust to the presence or absence of niche differences between spe- cies and even the presence or absence of conspecific density dependence. Future work should examine whether they are similarly robust to habitat heterogeneity and habitat specialization, which have been hypothesized to be primary factors determining the slopes of species-area relationships at intermediate scales (Shmida and Wilson 1985). In addition, we should look for other community-level patterns that are more sensitive to the underlying processes; cluster size distributions of species may be such a pattern (J. B. Plotkin, J. Chave, and P. S. Ashton)

Traditional spatial analyses are problematic when multiple species are considered As long as ecological equivalency is assumed, the results reported here seem robust across all dispersal kernels, although changing the dispersal kernel will alter the temporal and spatial scale of the patterns produced.

Spatially implicit neutral models have been shown to produce
species abundance distributions (SADs) in remarkable good
agreement with empirical data [5,19]. This suggests that they
capture the essence of general and robust community-level
properties or, at least, promotes neutral theories to suitable null-
models [20]. Etienne et al. [21] showed that SADs remain
unaltered when breaking Hubbell’s [5] ‘‘zero-sum assumption’’,
postulating that the community size is strictly kept constant by
resource saturation. Then, the question arises of whether the
spatial distribution of species is equally robust upon modifying
other ‘‘details’’ of the underlying neutral theory? (see [22]).

Multifractal analysis is a powerful tool for the description of complex objects (Falconer 1997, Harte 2001), developed in the field of statistical physics and applied nowadays in a wide range of sciences. In ecological research, the technique was used to characterize different environments (Kirkpatrick and Weishampel 2005, Montero 2005), to describe ecological time series such as dynamics of plankton biomass in the intertidal zone (Seuront et al. 1999, Seuront and Lagadeuc 2001) and to describe the spatial distribution of biomass and single species (Sole and Manrubia 1995, Appleby 1996, Seuront and Spilmont 2002). At the community level, multifractal analysis was proposed to characterize community structure in spatial (Borda-de-Agua et al. 2002) and nonspatial contexts (Iudin and Gelashviliy 2003).

It seems likely that the relative abundances within a largish group of species will be 
governed by the interplay of many more-or-less independent factors. It is, moreover, in the nature of the dynamics of interacting populations that these several factors should compound multiplicatively. The statistical central limit theorem applied to such a product of factors implies a lognormal distribution.

As models for spatial data, multifractals have the further advantage that they impose weaker conditions on the data than are required by classical statistics. For example, Ripley's K (Fortin 1999) requires isotropy — which means that the statistical properties of any transect must be independent of its direction (Cressie 1993). However, multifractals can successfully be fitted to non-isotropic data (Harte 2001).

Of course real data will not have the property of self-similarity. When we say that the data are well fitted by MFb, we are not claiming that the data set constitutes a self-similar density. Instead, we claim that the data are multifractal, in the sense of exhibiting detail at all scales, and that furthermore the data resemble MFb in a multifractal sense we make precise in the section below.

In that sense, MFb provides a scale-free measure of spatial variability despite the fact that the data have to include multiple scales for the model to apply. Since it is scale-free, MFb can be used for comparisons of species richness and other densities at widely disparate scales, as we do here.

To compare two multifractals, we follow the common practice of comparing their Rényi dimensions D(q) (Harte 2001). These dimensions change most rapidly for q near zero; we use the integers from -10 to 10. 

In this sense, it appears plausible that ecology is basically multifractal, and that MFb is the most parsimonious model of this phenomenon.

Moreover, it is inherently non-stationary, like much of environmental variation and unlike the usual assumption in spatial statistics.

Applications of multifractals to ecology still remain extremely anecdotic, limited to forest ecology (Scheuring and Riedi 1994; Solé and Manrubia 1995a, 1995b, 1996; Manrubia and Solé 1996;Drake and Weishampel 2000, 2001), population dynamics (Ozik et al. 2005), the characterization of species-area relationship, species diversity, and species abundance distribution (Ricotta 2000; Ricotta et al. 2002; Borda-de-Água et al. 2002; Iudin and Gelashvily 2003; Laurie and Perrier 2007), and the characterization of nutrient, phyto- and zooplankton patchiness (Pascual et al. 1995; Seuront et al. 1996a, 1996b, 1999, 2002; Lovejoy et al. 2001).

With a competition–colonization trade-off, coexistence is often thought of as the product of non-equilibrium, spatially dependent processes (Connell 1978; Huston 1979), where these chance events present different niche opportunities for species. Connell’s (1978) intermediate disturbance hypothesis viewed local richness as dependent on the time since disturbance, where soon after a disturbance colonizing species establish populations.

Since desertification might involve tipping points at unknown thresholds and is often difficult to reverse, the development of indicators based on spatial patterns could be important for ecosystem management to predict when catastrophic change is looming.

Fixed-point attractor: we say that the dynamic converged to a fixed-point attractor if the system did not change in the frequency of occupied patches in two successive generations. Statistical steady-state: we say that the dynamic converged to a statistical steady-state when the proportion of cells in each state, as measured by the Shannon entropy of the system,
remain bounded to very small fluctuations around a fixed value, although the system
changes with no apparent trend over time.
Non-convergent: we say that the system did not converge if after 10 500 generations we do
not find any of the above mentioned attractors.

Previous studies revealed a negative correlation between vegeta- tion homogeneity (DI ) and plant species diversity in semi-arid shrubland ecosystems (Alados et al., 2003; Alados et al., 2006). In the Middle Atlas and Central Pyrenees grassland ecosys- tems, we also observed an inverse relationship between DI and species diversity. The intensity of the relationship was similar in both regions, which indicates its consistency, despite the differences in species diversity and land degradation of the two areas. That result is consistent with the general phenomenon of great spatial diversity in heterogeneous habitats than in equivalent homogeneous habitats, which occurs because heterogeneous habitats contain a variety of types of habitat patches, which allows organisms that have different resource requirements to coexist and, thereby, increases the number of species in the community.

One way to measure the stability of a system is to analyze the coefficient of temporal variation in its biomass (Tilman et al., 1996; Doak et al., 1998; McNaughton, 1977, 1985). Also, spatio-temporal heterogeneity of ecosystems can be used to determine the level of resilience and/or re- sistance of ecosystem to disturbance (Holling, 1973; Li, 2000). Assuming that spatial scale patterns re- flect changes in temporal scale patterns (Watt, 1947; Halley, 1996), then the fractal spatial patterns of a plant community can be used to assess its emergent dynamics (Allen and Starr, 1982). The

This change in the fractal dimension indicates a substantial change in the processes that generate the plants’ spatial patterns (Krummel et al., 1987; Li, 2000). Thus,

Many ecological applications Prey and predator size relationships have used quantile regression as a method of estimating rates of change for functions along or near the upper boundary of the conditional distribution of response The response of the organism cannot change by more than some upper limit set by the measured factors, but may change by less when other unmeasured factors are limiting

This second parameter is needed because we are interested in transient states rather than
in the steady state. The reason for this is simple: the set of censuses for tropical forests
collected by the Center for Tropical Forest Science reveal that they are non-stationary
systems: species richness decreases from one census to the next in all tropical forests and
in many cases at a considerable pace [32]. Just to cite some examples: at BCI (Panama),
roughly 3% of the number of species have been disappearing every 5 years; for Bukit Timah
(Singapore), this percentage varies between 3% and 8% between consecutive censuses; for
Edoro (Congo) 12% of the species disappeared between the 1994 census and the 2000
census, etc. The dynamics of the RSA between censuses in each forest are also far from
being steady. It is noteworthy that most analyses of the BCI (and of other tropical forests)
largely involve fitting separately several metrics of community structure and organization
(e.g. SAR, RSA, indices of diversity) for each census rather than considering them as a
dynamic sequence whose attributes needs be fitted together [9]–[11].

Ergodicity means that averages over time (i.e. averages over repeated operations of the process) are the same as the corresponding spatial averages.

The box counting dimension of the support of /mu describes the geometric dimension or
the size of the support while the Renyi dimensions Dq (q!=0) describe the non-uniformity of the measure.

Pag. 62 Case Study: Microscale Distribution of Microphytobenthos Biomass

Recent results have also revealed that the high diversity and rapid turnover of microphytobenthos populations make them ideal as a model system for the study of ecological theory (such as diversity vs. productivity issues) and aspects of ecosystem change such as global warming

A more intuitive definition that can directly be applied in ecology stated that “this form of vari- ability reflects heterogeneous distributions with a few dense patches and a wide range of low density patches” (Seuront et al. 2001). 

However, a general consensus can be reached considering that a given pattern or process is intermittent in space or in time if (1) it is characterized by sharp local fluctuations, (2) it is responsible for a skewed probability distribution, and (3) it has a long-term memory signature, perceptible from the power-law form of its autocorrelation function.

In ecology, the term variability refers to changes in the values of a given quantitative or qualitative descriptor; it is distinct from heterogeneity, which refers to a composition of different entities or kinds of elements (Kolasa and Rollo 1991; Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 2008).
This distinction is, however, not as clear as may appear at first glance, with meanings essentially dependent on the choice of approach (Naeem and Colwell 1991; Shashack and Brand 1991). Even papers devoted to the synthesis of these concepts (Kolasa and Rollo 1991; Naeem and Colwell 1991; Shashack and Brand 1991) may be misleading in that spatial and temporal heterogeneity are used to describe spatial or temporal variability, respectively, irrespective of the basic previous definitions.

Intriguingly, however, the aggregate behavior of the whole communities—the sum of relative neighborhood density across species— was indeed fractal, and showed very consistent patterns across forests (Fig. 1). The most abundant species had relatively gentle declines and large x-intercepts, while rare species had steep declines and smaller x-intercepts.
