# **Outline** Species rank distributions in space: a multifractal analysis

* SAR and SAD 

* One of robust way to analyze SAD is RAD 

* SAR extension are multifractals

* We can extend RAD to spatial RAD an analyze it as multifractals

* The meaning of SRSDq and its differences with SADDq

	Generate spatial distributions with different patterns, a pattern with SAR z=1, SAD uniforme 64 especies, randomized version of this should give the same SAR,
	and a sample of random distribution with known SAD, and then the neutral model with aggregated distribution. 

* which is more powerfull for detecting patterns.

Multifractals could be usefull to detect break in scaling because with higher q the breaks can be detected with higher sensitivity.

D1 and D0 should not be used because high type I error and low power.

SAD cannot detect patterns in low species communities, but DqSRS can, DqSAD should not be used because of a high Type I error.

The AD test combined with SAD is quite capable of detect different communities around 64 species or more.
