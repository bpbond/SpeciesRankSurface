# **Outline** Species rank distributions in space: a multifractal analysis

* SAR and SAD 

* One of robust way to analyze SAD is RAD 

* SAR extension are multifractals

* We can extend RAD to spatial RAD an analyze it as multifractals

* The meaning of SRSDq and its differences with SADDq

	Generate spatial distributions with different patterns, a pattern with SAR z=1, SAD uniforme 64 especies, randomized version of this should give the same SAR,
	and a sample of random distribution with known SAD, and then the neutral model with aggregated distribution. 

* which is more powerfull for detecting patterns.
