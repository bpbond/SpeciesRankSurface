Dear Editor,

I am sending you the manuscript “A new method to analyze species abundances in space using generalized dimensions” for consideration for publication in Methods in Ecology and Evolution.

In this manuscript I describe and test the statistical power of a new way to analyze species abundance distributions in space. The new method uses the ranks species derived from abundance distribution and analyzed them using generalized The approach of generalized dimensions is similar to analyzing the relationship of Hill's diversity index with area. I generate simple species distribution patterns and neutral/hierarchical model simulations to calculate the statistical power. I compare different methods to calculate generalized dimensions and  related methodologies like SAD and fractal information dimension. The new method performs well to characterize different communities and could be used to study the scaling of diversity.

Thank you for receiving my manuscript and considering it for review. I appreciate your time and look forward to your response

Sincerely,

Leonardo A. Saravia
